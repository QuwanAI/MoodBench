Charles: I may do it as well. I feel weird recently, bloated and I gain weight even though I don't eat much
Karen: But do you feel differently after eating gluten? Jack's right, you should do a blood test first, but you can test it yourself. Stop eating gluten for a month and see if you feel better
Monica: I did the same thing with lactose, I wasn't feeling great after drinking coffee with milk, etc. I stopped eating it and I'm much better now
Jack: But did it happen suddenly or were you always like this?
Monica: It just happened, I was all right until I wasn't. I don't know how it works, but it happens
Charles: I think it's the same with me. I was fine, but recently it's a real nightmare
Karen: You should quit eating gluten and see, otherwise you should look for a different explanation. Maybe it has nothing to do with food?
Charles: I had a basic blood test and everything's fine. My GP said all my problems are linked to my diet
Karen: It may be, but I'm not so sure. Although, changing your diet and eating healthier can't do you any harm
Monica: You should read the articles I sent you, check the symptoms and what you shouldn't eat

Sophie: That's very very kind of him! He's really a darling.
Sophie: We won't be going your direction any time soon I'm afraid. How long will they keep? Is it windfall?
Noah: Both really but they all look very healthy. No bruises afa one can see. Or only odd small ones. They' be alright for a couple of days I guess. The weather's cool.
Sophie: It would be a shame if they rotted. I'll talk to Frank and maybe to the twins too and go back to you asap.
Noah: OK.
Sophie: Hey Noah, the twins will be on their way from Notts tomorrow afternoon and passing Windfield. Is it alright if they pop in and collect the quince?
Noah: Absolutely! In fact anyone can come any time and just take them from our terrace. Of course it would be great to see your twins again. Haven't seen them for ages!

Noah: Notts is 3 hours' drive away so small wonder they don't fancy it so much.
Sophie: I don't blame them! We're both happy they've been doing fine at college. Everything's absolutely fine. You don't have William at home all that often either, do you?
Noah: He gets 5 days at Xmas by way of ""family care"" and 2 weeks off spread over the whole year but never longer that 5 days. They have a strict regime at the academy. But after all these years we've learned to cope with it. What worries me is that he seems to have no time to even think about getting married and start a family of his own.
Sophie: The fate of most military I guess. Hugely unfair I'd say. Like being married to your regiment!
Noah: That's what it sounds like when he talks about himself! I never hear a girl's name! And when I ask, he gets brusque.
Sophie: Oh dear! What could it mean?
Noah: No, not what you think! We know from Capt. Broomsberg about their common escapades. Plenty of women but only that sort of women. No strings.
Sophie: I never even imagined he might be gay! Surely not. But there must be sth else.
Noah: We think he's just so obsessively career-minded. Nothing else counts for him.
Sophie: He's always been very strong-willed. And he knows what he wants. Well if I were you I wouldn't worry at all.
Noah: You're probably right. But you know I'd love it so much to have plenty of grandchildren around me.

Bobby: Imagine that pharmaceutical companies invent illnesses!
Mickey: What? Are u sure?
Bobby: No, I'm not, but in the commercial they mentioned a name of an illness I have never heard of.
Mickey: So what? There are many illnesses and diseases I've never heard of. 
Bobby: So I did some research. Turns out such a thing does not exist. No medical journal writes about it, no medical forum suggests caution.
Mickey: That doesn't mean it doesn't exist. 
Bobby: I even found a youtube video of a doctor explaining y it's not an illness. 
Mickey: All right, this is quite serious.
Bobby: So I put my mind to it and do u know what I came up with?
Mickey: What?
Bobby: That in this particular case they're selling mints as medical products!
Mickey: Srsly?!
Bobby: Absolutely!
Mickey: How long do u think they've been lying to us?
Bobby: Can't be sure, but probably 4ever. Imagine every illness, disease and so on. Where do these come from? Why do they spread so fast?
Mickey: That is kinda puzzling.
Bobby: Right?
Mickey: So why is no one doing anything about it?
Bobby: Do u know how much the pharmaceutical industry is worth today?
Mickey: No.
Bobby: At least $1.2 bln!
Mickey: Explains a lot.","Bobby's most annoyed by pharmaceutical companies. He believes they invent diseases to make money. He discovered that one company is selling mints as medicine for an illness that doesn't exist."

Phil: I know, but imagine - ur keen on technology and u get all the news in one place. Then u can choose what to read and what not.
Nancy: Sounds sensible. Does it have something 4 fashion?
Phil: Probably so. Not sure, though.
Nancy: How about u, Vic?
Vic: I still prefer Facebook. Had Twitter once, but the interaction with others is nothing compared with Facebook.
Phil: Well, it's intended in a completely different way. 
Vic: What do u mean?
Phil: IMO, Twitter is not for interacting like on Facebook, but for getting news fast and from reliable, more or less, sources. U can follow anyone and anyone can follow u.
Vic: Still, on Facebook I can share stuff with my friends, join groups and talk about things that interest me. And I don't have to limit myself to 140 characters.
Phil: 280. Still, a downside. OTOH, if ppl were able to write as much as they wanted, Twitted would get as cluttered as Facebook.
Nancy: So no one uses 4 example Instagram?
Vic: I do. 
Phil: Not 4 me. I don't post that many pictures online. 
Nancy: But u can follow ppl and see what they're doing or offering. There are also companies on Instagram.
Phil: I know, but I'm more interested in news and gossip than seeing someone post a picture of their breakfast. 
Vic: That's not all ppl post on Instagram!
Phil: So, what else?
Vic: Depends on ur interest. I, for one, like to observe all the fitness accounts :)
Phil: And does this motivate u to train?
Vic: No, but it gives me hints what to do and what not. 
Nancy: What do u think about Tumblr?
Phil: What?
Vic: Heard about it, but never had an account.
Nancy: It's a microblogging website. U can post blog entries, pictures and basically everything u want there. And ppl can observe u!
Phil: Don't have that much time to write a blog.
Vic: Me neither. 
Phil: Nancy, y do u ask these questions? ;)

Clara: Well, yes! I just said it was, LOL. It's about a fictional Ivy League University and the students in one House of Residence.
Neela: Why is it called Dear White People?
Clara: That's the name of the radio show the main character, Sam, presents on college radio.
Neela: Yeah, but why is it so good?
Clara: Well, it's mainly stories from the perspective of black students there, which I find very interesting. The characters are strong and likeable too.
Neela: I suppose it's rather different from the UK, then?
Clara: It seems so, as there is a lot more racial awareness and discrimination there than here. It all kicks off when there is a Blackface party held by an elite group of white students, which gets out of hand.
Neela: How's that?
Clara: Well, obviously, the black students try to break it up and there's also an incident where one guy, Reggie, gets a loaded gun pointed at him by a campus policeman after he gets into an argument with a white student. It may be at another party, though, I'm not sure of that.
Neela: Oh, that sounds pretty strong stuff. What else happens?
Clara: Well, there is a young black guy called Lionel who is coming to terms with being gay and is finding his voice as a journalist. He unearths corruption at the uni and he and Sam also uncover some conspiracy theory stuff about secret societies.
Neela: Well, I must say, it does sound good, I'll check it out soon!
Clara: Definitely, there is supposed to be a Series 3 coming up next year, really looking forward to it!
